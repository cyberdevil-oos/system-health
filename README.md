 System Health
-------------------------------------------- 
External libraries (need to be installed):


psutil - For system and process monitoring
requests - For HTTP requests
winreg - For Windows registry access (Windows-only)
pywin32 (win32api, win32process) - Optional, for process priority control on Windows

You can install the external libraries using pip:
pip install psutil requests pywin32
Note that this script is designed specifically for Windows systems, as it uses Windows-specific libraries like winreg and pywin32. The script will exit if run on a non-Windows system.
Would you like me to help you install these libraries or explain what each one does in more detail?Â CopyRetryJgive me a github description for the file i gave you that includes the external libraries thats neededEditHere's a GitHub description for your system maintenance tool:
